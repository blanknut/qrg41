# HP-41 Quick Reference Guides for Extension Modules

This project is a web site (available at https://qrg41.fjk.ch/) which
provides basic operational information about a few modules for the
Hewlett Packard Series 41 calculators. The selection is mainly made
on my own needs. However, I will also listen to your wishes. Hopefully
the information available here will grow over time.
