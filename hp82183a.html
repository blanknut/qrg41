          While the HP 82183A Extended I/O Module is plugged into the HP-41, the
          following functions are available for your use. All functions are
          programmable. Appropriate peripherals must be connected to the
          Hewlett-Packard Interface Loop for most of the functions to be
          executed normally.

              Enables primary device to respond to a parallel poll. Uses
              <i>enable number</i> in X to assign one of the eight parallel poll
              bits to device and to specify whether device requests service.
              Using an enable number in the range 0 &leq; |x| &leq; 7 assigns
              bit number |x| and indicates "Service Not Requested". Using an
              enable number in the range 8 &leq; |x| &leq; 15 assigns bit number
              (|x| - 7) and indicates "Service Requested". (The fractional part
              of any enable number is ignored.)
